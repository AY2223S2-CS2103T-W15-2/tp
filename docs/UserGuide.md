## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `trackr.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your Trackr.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar trackr.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `add_order n/John Doe l/John Street d/2023-12-12 q/10 f/Cupcakes p/91234567` : Adds an order for John Doe to the order list.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add_supplier n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add_supplier n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items in curly brackets need to have at least 1 item supplied.
  e.g. `{p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL}` can be used as `p/91234567` or `e/john@example.com` but cannot be left blank.

* Items with `…​` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
