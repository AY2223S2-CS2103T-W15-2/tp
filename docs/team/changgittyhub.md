### Project: Trackr

Trackr is a desktop tracking application used to keep track of order, suppliers and tasks. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* Added the ability to edit  to a menu and list tasks.
  * What it does:
    * Allows users to add menu items with name, price, and cost. A profit for the item is calculated.
  * Justification: This feature is made to cater to the needs of home business owners as they usually have a lot of tasks (such as ordering supplies, making deliveries) to deal with
    and the app provides a convenient way to record down and get an overview of their tasks.
  * Credits: Code is adapted from [AddressBook-Level3 project](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2223S2/tp) created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org)


* **New Feature**: Implemented a feature to get profit from item cost and item selling price .
  * What it does:
    * Allows users to see the profit of their item after adding their menu item to the menu.
  * Justification: This feature allows home business owners to see their profit for each menu item at one glance.It also allows the total profit seen on the homepage to work.
  * Highlights: Users are able to see the profit from each menu item without calculating manually.
