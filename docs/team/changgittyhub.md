### Project: Trackr

Trackr is a desktop tracking application used to keep track of order, menu, suppliers and tasks. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* Added `Menu` Model including all field classes [\#177](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/pull/177), [#107] (https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/pull/107)
* Updated Storage related classes to allow for the storage of `Menu` objects [\#114] (https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/pull/114)
* Completed `add`, `delete`, `edit` and `find` commands for `Menu` objects
* Completed `edit` and `find` commands for `Order` objects [\#134](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/pull/134)

* **New Feature**: Implemented a `Calculate Menu Item Profit` feature to get profit from item cost and item selling price.
  * What it does:
    * Allows users to see the profit of their item after adding their menu item to the menu.
  * Justification: This feature allows home business owners to see their profit for each menu item at one glance.It also allows the total profit seen on the homepage to work.
  * Highlights: Users are able to see the profit from each menu item without calculating manually.
