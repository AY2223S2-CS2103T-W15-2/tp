### Project: Trackr

Trackr is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add tasks to a task list and edit existing tasks.
    * What it does: 
      * Allows the user to add tasks with task description, deadline of task and completion status (DONE / NOT DONE) of task.
      * Allows users to edit existing tasks so that they can keep tasks details correct and up to date.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because home business owners has a lot of tasks (such as ordering supplies, making deliveries) to deal with
      and the app provides a convenient way to record down and get an overview of their tasks.
    * Highlights: -
    * Credits: Code is adapted from [AddressBook-Level3 project](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2223S2/tp) created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org)
